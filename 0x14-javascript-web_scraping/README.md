# 0x14. Javascript - Web scraping

This project involved practicing file I/O on Node.js and using the NPM request framework to interact with both the [Star Wars](https://swapi.co/) and [JSONplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API's. I was introduced to Javascript web scraping using the `request` and `fs` modules.
